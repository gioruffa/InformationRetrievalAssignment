Our car is a D4 SE Nav, meaning it has a 187bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine under the bonnet. SE Nav is one step up from entry-level SE in the old Volvo trim level pecking order, the only addition being – you guessed it – satellite navigation. Standard equipment includes 17in alloy wheels, leather seats, two-zone climate control and a 7.0in colour infotainment screen. Added to that, our car has a whole heap of options, included among them front and rear park assist, a rear-view camera and tinted rear windows.
