This just hit my pizza craving right on the spot. Perfect thin crust dough, with dreamy fluffy edges, and the firewood oven makes just enhances all the flavours. Toppings are excellent - authentic southern Italian flavours makes you forget where you are for a moment. Staff is lovely, great atmosphere, very reasonably priced for what you get - just excellent. Not just the best in the neighbourhood, but well worth travelling to if you're not nearby! We had a pizza here from the wooden fired oven. We walked in the restaurant after a busy morning outing with much walking and sight-seeing but we returned with our friends for dinner one night.
