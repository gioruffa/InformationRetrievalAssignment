In terms of infotainment, Active cars get Bluetooth, a USB socket, a radio and even a CD player. A 7.0in touchscreen and a DAB radio are optional on Active but standard on Outdoor models. The touchscreen is fairly easy to navigate, although some of the icons are small and the system can be a bit sluggish to respond. If you want sat-nav, it’s a reasonably priced option, but only on Outdoor trim.
