I brought a white dress I’d worn to a Holi festival in India, which had a few lingering neon-pink stains. After about an hour in our avocado brew, it quickly turned a pale peach. A colleague dyed her cotton T-shirt in a separate pot where Lux had sprinkled iron into the avo mix: “Anytime you add iron, it turns the dye a gray color,” she explained. “You can even drop in a rusty nail.” As promised, the cotton instantly soaked up a pale, silvery hue. Other editors tried Lux’s technique for flower petal prints: Arranging old (but not dried) flowers on silk or cotton, laying a piece of silk on top, and hammering them with a mallet. The color from the petals seeps through almost instantly—and it’s a good stress reliever too.
