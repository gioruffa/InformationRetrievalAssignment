The set of photos that Buffalo London has shared alongside the relaunch announcement, which stars models Ruby Aldridge and Aleali May, recontextualizes the shoe for the modern era. Alexandra Preusche, the brand’s global marketing director, describes the shoe’s high-fashion potential: “Our brand was carried into the mainstream by a group of influencers—in the ’90s, it was the Spice Girls—so we loved the idea of re-creating this and bringing it into the spirit of today through some of the industry’s top influencers,” she says. “We are excited for the U.S. consumer to discover the brand on the feet of today’s fashion crowd.”
