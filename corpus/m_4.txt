Then there’s the handling, which is a long way behind rival efforts. The steering is extremely low and heavy, so it takes a lot of concentration to drive the Wrangler quickly along a country road. That, combined with lots of body lean and a very unsettled ride, means there’s very little pleasure to be had pushing the car hard. Indeed, whatever your speed, the Wrangler picks up and is unsettled by even minor road imperfections, and there’s a considerable amount of tyre and diesel engine noise inside when above 30mph. We have yet to try the V6 petrol but we suspect it might be a tad less vocal and transmit less vibration through the controls.
