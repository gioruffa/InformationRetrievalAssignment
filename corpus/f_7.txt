A whole universe hides inside a woman’s handbag, telling about her. Maxi or micro, it keeps secrets and it's a bearer of style. Baldinini Trend shopping bags and tote bags are perfect to contain affections, but they can also carry all the “tools of the trade”; satin and leather rucksacks mix practicality and style. Mini saddle bags with inserts, studs or original Hiro prints are adorable; baguette bags in soft colours are elegant and classic. Geometric and neat shapes ensure practicality and tell about a modern, young and refined style. Extremely soft hides and the features of made in Italy guarantee quality over time. Bands, leather strips, artwork, studs and stones: attention to details is a must.
