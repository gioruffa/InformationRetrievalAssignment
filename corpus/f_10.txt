In the women's collection, soft silhouettes draw nappa jackets with sharp cuts and suede inserts to squeeze on the waist and wear with piebald mules for a wild look; the total black version is sophisticated and chic. Microperforated jackets instead are tightened to the body and have spinning shapes; soft and fit volumes, slightly oversize, for the ice grey super soft down jacket. Slim fit lines for leather and biker jackets: glam-rock the newest, with a shower of studs on black, white and vivid red; the nude nappa versions witg laser perforation veer to chic.
