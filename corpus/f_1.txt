Consider the sudden rise of high-street bridal. Last year, Reformation—beloved for its sexy, vintage-y day dresses—launched a wedding line. There’s an understated ivory satin dress for $428; a lacy sweetheart gown for $488; and a ruffled, deep-V dress for $388. There’s also a dozen bridesmaid dresses in shades of blush, lilac, navy, and olive for under $400. That price is similar to a lot of “true” bridesmaid labels out there, but Reformation’s bridesmaid dresses look a lot more current (and flattering) than the ones you’d find in a traditional shop.
