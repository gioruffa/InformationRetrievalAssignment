We’ve also got three option packs fitted to our car: the Driver Support Pack adds collision warning with automatic braking, among many other warning and detection devices; the Winter Pack adds heated front seats and a heated windscreen; and the Family Pack chucks in two integrated booster seats for young children travelling in the rear. All told, these options added £4720 to the cost of our car when it was new, meaning an on-the-road price last year of £37,405. And herein lies the crux of our test: this XC60 may no longer be the last word in fashion, but buying it at a year old for an estimated cost of £24,500 could save you £13,000.
