I'm one of few people in the world that has eaten a slice of pizza everyday for at least one full year in their life - I was in college living in New York and tried to spend $2 (lunch) to $5 (dinner) on meals. So I ate many slices, predominantly at St. Marks Pizza (not reall that good) and a little place called John's in Brooklyn Heights
