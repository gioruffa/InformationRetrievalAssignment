Thank Chanel for the resurgence in chic rainwear options. No longer are packed-up jackets the answer for staying dry in the summer months. Oh no. Make sure to pack a plastic patent hat for all excursions, ideally in a bucket-meets-boater style. Maybe this summer you've got a wedding to attend and you're so keen to stay far away from fascinators that you're even considering wearing a beanie hat? The answer comes in the form of much - literally - cooler options. A straw boater fastened with a ribbon will work well with a floral print, while choosing a printed turban style à la Marc Jacobs could be the head-turning option your outfit has been missing.
