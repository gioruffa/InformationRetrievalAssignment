It’s also well built, as you’d expect for the money. All the controls and switches have a solid feel and, while the 911 GT3’s materials can seem more functional than plush, those lashings of Alcantara relay the impression of a sports car with a focused intent. If you want, you can make it swankier by personalising it in a multitude of ways, but for a price. Visibility is pretty good compared with those mid-engined supercars that tend to hide what’s behind you, namely the Audi R8, Lamborghini Huracán and Ferrari 488. The horizontal line of the big rear wing across the rear screen is a slight blot, but this can be deleted if you wish. Whether you choose to keep it or not, it’s well worth adding the optional rear-view camera, just to avoid an embarrassing bump.
