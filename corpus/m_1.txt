If you want a petrol Partner Tepee, we’d pay a little more for the Puretech 110. As long as you’re not expecting brisk performance, it’s perfectly happy hauling the car along and pulls much harder from low in the rev range. A pair of diesels are available with 99bhp and 118bhp. Both feel relatively muscular from low engine speeds but are significantly more expensive. They’re also not as refined as the petrol units, unsurprisingly.
