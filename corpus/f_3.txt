To get the most out of the shoes, Lyons says, the wearer must set an intention for each pair upon unboxing (she suggests doing this via a short meditation). She also advises wearers to remember to breathe deeply and attune to that intention each time they slip them on. As time passes and desires are realized, the stones should also be recharged and reprogrammed regularly, which she says can be done by waving Palo Santo or sage smoke toward them or placing them under the light of the full moon. “Cleansing will clear a stagnant flow, and charging keeps gemstones bright and radiant,” she says.
