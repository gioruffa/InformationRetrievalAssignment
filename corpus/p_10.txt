We were longing for a real Neapolitan pizza and Made in South did not disappoint.
The oven, especially imported to provide the genuine product, delivered delicious pizzas, thin, flexible, perfectly cooked in the wood fired oven with toppings originating from the Naples region like the mozzarella, the friarielli (typical Neapolitan broccoli) the mushrooms, the tomatoes and much more. Agnese our waitress did her best to ensure that all our needs were catered for and thanks to Antonio, the owner for a wonderful evening.
