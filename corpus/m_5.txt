There is a petrol option of the Tourneo Connect, but we have yet to try it. And because it’s a 1.0-litre three-cylinder unit with only 99bhp, it’s unlikely to be sprightly. The 1.5-litre diesel comes in two states of tune: 99bhp and 118bhp. So far, we’ve driven only the pokier version – yet we’re duty-bound to report that sadly there’s not much poke from this. It’s fine if you’re simply ambling around town, but get it on the motorway and you’ll discover precious little oomph below 2000rpm and breathlessness above 4000rpm, leaving just a narrow band of supine surge in-between. Ford claims a lacklustre 0-62mph time of 12.6sec – and bear in mind that’s before you’ve filled it to the gunwales with people and things.
